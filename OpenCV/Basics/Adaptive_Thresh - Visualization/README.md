# Adaptive Threshold

# Code overview
Adaptive threshold techniques for segmentation of binary images.

THRESH_BINARY tecnique is used for each of the block-size * block-size image region.

ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C and ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C methods are used to compute local threshold value for different block-sizes.

# Code Instructions
The block-size and the constant for both methods can be modified live using trackbars. This ensures a better and easier way of visualising the final result of the operation using different parameters.
