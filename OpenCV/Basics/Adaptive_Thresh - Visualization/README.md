# Adaptive Threshold

# Code overview
Adaptive threshold techniques for segmentation of binary images.
+ THRESH_BINARY tecnique is used for each of the block-size * block-size image region.
+ ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C and ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C methods are used to compute local threshold value for different block-sizes.

# Code Instructions
+ Modify values for block-size and the constant for the algorithm using trackbars.
+ Use esc to exit.
